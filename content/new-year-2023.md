It's new years' time! Hope you all had a good holiday season, I did. I was in US in December; one week in Austin, Texas followed by another week in New York.

For this new year, I only want to renew my old resolutions:

- write more actively
- read more. I have 15 new books on engineering leadership, scaling organisations, growing teams. Hopefully I will revive my Kindle love this year
- eat healthy. I have already cut down on sugar. While in US I tried to drink sugarless coffee and it worked and I have been continuing that breakfast routine back in Berlin too.
- stay fit.
