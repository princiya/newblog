I gave my first keynote at WWCode Connect Recharge 2022. I am humbled by this opportunity. As a leadership fellow with WWCode I get to interact with the community and be recognised as a leader outside of my regular day to day job too. Thank you WWCode!

I got featured in Forbes - [Link](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alainapercival/2021/12/01/the-wisdom-of-women-leaders-as-they-forge-the-post-pandemic-future/)

### How has having female leadership helped you in your career?

It has helped to bring in more women/female easily into the job.

### What would you tell the women leaders who has impacted your career?

Thank you for being there and continuing to be awesome.

### What traits have you or want to mimic based on other women in leadership?

I like being authentic about myself. It is about who I am and being able to bring myself wholly into the job. I encourage others to do the same. Creating this kind of environment where everyone can be authentic about themselves is what I strive for. Empathy is the next important trait I care about. I was once asked “how to empathise with people when you haven’t been in the situation”. During these times I like to take the time to learn more about the situation itself. Listening well helps to empathise in situations when you cannot show direct empathy.

### What is your personal philosophy about being a great leader?

Great leader is about being a good human being first. To define a great leader in one line - “it is to be able to hold the helm when the sea is not calm”.
