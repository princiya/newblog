I am an Engineering Manager and an Engineering Leader. What is the difference?

This can be an interview question and it is very important to be prepared with a good answer here.

When I was asked this interview question during one of the panel rounds at Anaconda, I really liked this question.

The first obvious difference to come to my mind based on my experience is that as a leader I often try to lead by an example. As a manager, I need to ensure that I manage people and project deliverables.

|Leader | Manager |
|----- | ----- |
| One who leads | One who manages |
| Leading by examples and leading from the front | Manage people and projects |
| Influence and motivate the team | Delegate, orchestrate things within the team | 

> All leaders are not managers
