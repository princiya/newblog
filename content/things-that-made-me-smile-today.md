Happy Monday! Yet another Monday, but I had a relaxing day today after a 4 day long weekend.

Bonus, it is US holiday today, it is memorial day there and my US colleagues are having a long weekend too. This is also the reason why my day is not too packed today.

I received the following message on Linkedin today.

```
I don't know if you remember me but we were in the same class in the first year of Engg. at NMAMIT i.e., in 2005. I was a Civil Engg. student. I have been following your updates on Twitter and admire your thoughts and community efforts. Great to see you doing well.
```

This made me smile and made my Monday <3.

I also went to Savory Chay today, one of my favorite lunch places in Berlin and met a colleague over lunch.

The food was delicious.

I plan to cook lasagna for dinner today, fingers crossed!
