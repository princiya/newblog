"Too often, we put pressure on ourselves to have everything figured out before we get started."

We want the perfect plan, the perfect execution, and the perfect outcome. But here's the truth: we'll never be able to perfectly predict the future, our initial assumptions are often inaccurate, and there are many things we don't even know that we don't know. Liz’s illustration captures this well.

Taking the first step is crucial, as it helps you move from inaction to action. The path to success is rarely linear, but by embracing imperfection and uncertainty, you'll develop resilience and adaptability.

Here's a simple approach I’ve found helpful for many of my team’s projects:

1️⃣ Define the problem: Clearly articulate the challenge or goal you're trying to tackle. This sets your intention and focuses your energy. Know how you’ll measure success.

2️⃣ Make a flexible plan: Develop a plan, but be prepared to change it. Think of it as a roadmap, not a rigid script. This keeps you open to new ideas and opportunities.

3️⃣ Revisit and adjust: Regularly review your progress and make any necessary adjustments. This iterative process helps you learn, evolve, and make improvements along the way.

Remember, progress over perfection.

In case you’re curious how this applies to OKRs (objectives and key results): We review our OKRs on a quarterly basis and make necessary adjustments. This regular check-in allows you to learn from your successes and failures, and to adapt your strategies based on the evolving circumstances.

When you accept that the journey will be imperfect, you open yourself up to growth, learning, and ultimately, success. So, give yourself permission to take that first step and trust that you'll learn and improve as you go.
