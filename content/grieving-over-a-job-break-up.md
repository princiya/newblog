It's been a year! On this day, last year, I resigned from my previous job where I was the Head of Frontend Engineering at Curalie GmbH for 3 years.

I had grown in this role into engineering leadership and I could not have been happier with my career path. But after 3 years, it was also the time for me to move on and look for bigger challenges in an environment where values and culture were more valuable for the organisation.

## My time at Curalie

I joined Curalie as a Senior Frontend Engineer and took up the role as Lead Engineer shortly. During this time, I had a team to manage while also overseeing the product deliverables. I was one of the first 5 engineers in the company when I had joined and at the time when I left, the tech team was about ~50, and the frontend team had grown to ~12 people.

I was still hands-on coding on that role. On the frontend, our team used React and React Native. My favorite accomplishments:

- Setting up the entire automated build pipeline for React Native using Fastlane 
- Setting up automated end to end testing for React using Cypress, including api testing using Pact
- Setting up automated end to end - integration testing for React Native using Testproject.io that worked well with our manual QA team
- Strategising product deliverables and aligning the entire team with the roadmap
- Empathetic and authentic leadership

## Decision to move on was not hard, but emotional

Resigning from Curalie was not hard, but it turned out to be emotional, more than I expected.

I resigned, submitted my papers and had a loud cry.

It is during this time that I realised that I just had a job break up, a job that I enjoyed and had grown as a person and a leader. I had to grieve over it.

I asked the following question in Elpha.com.

> Dear Elpha community,
I handed in my resignation at work today. Although I still have the 3-month notice period and was passively preparing for this resignation, I was not ready for the kind of emotions I am having today.
I cried aloud and now I have this sense of loss although I know something exciting is waiting ahead.
How to deal with this or how to mourn effectively?

I got good advice from folks and I decided to use the time to say goodbyes to colleagues and work on a good handover.

## Interviewing and grieving

As funny as it apears to me today, on the day I resigned I sent an email to Anaconda saying after the first HR screen I was no longer interested in continuing the inteview process. Jessica, SVP Operations at Anaconda convinced me that I should take the Manager screen interview which was scheduled for the next day.

I had to grieve and I was not ready for an interview. I was tired and needed a break. But since the interview was already scheduled for the next day I decided to continue the interview process.

## Manager screen at Anaconda

I had no major expectations from the interview, but just after the interview started and I was talking to Nick, the then VP Engineering, I felt a connection. We also spoke about my resignation, me mourning and also how I was not looking forward to the interview and wanted it to be cancelled.

Towards the end of the hour, the call went beyond ~10 mins, and we both were happy about our interview. I wanted to a job at Anaconda and I was looking forward to the next rounds.

During the next panel rounds, I met amazing people who are now great colleagues. During the final round, I met Kevin, CTO, who is now my Manager at Anaconda.

We had 30 minutes scheduled, and knowing how busy a CTO would be, I had tried to read up as much as I could about Kevin so that I could ask him good questions in the 5 minutes that I would get after he would be done asking me questions.

But Kevin surprised me and asked if I had any questions in the beginning itself. My homework did pay, and we had a good conversation.

## Conclusion

I always listen to myself, always on the watch for any signs that bother me. I give a second chance, but beyond that I treat as warning signs and then believe in taking necessary actions.

Although things were good at Curalie, things became limited for my growth both in terms of salary and impact. I decided to resign.

But mourning over a job was a new experience and it is a thing!
