This was my pitch while applying for the wwcode fellowship.

---

Hi, My name is Princiya Sequeira. I am from India but now living in Germany. thanks to the job advertisement I found in the Women who code's newsletter 6 years ago which landed me a job here in Berlin. I have more than 10 years of experience building full-stack web & mobile applications, and 3 years of experience leading technical teams at scale.

Apart from my day job, I also volunteer in coaching under-represented folks with opensource contributions, advise them with career decisions, resume reviews, and interview preparations. Given this background, I am very excited to apply for this leadership fellow position because I want to be able to make an impact to a larger global audience. As an underrepresented person in tech myself, I understand the challenges and do believe and strive to have a diverse representation at a technical leadership level at companies and in opensource. I do take pride in being able to be at an engineering management position which I envisioned 10 years ago and to get here I have had to overcome multiple hurdles. It's not an easy road and this is what definitely keeps me motivated, but often there are times when I am alone all by myself and nobody to the immediate rescue. Communities and events like this are a great place where you find similar people with whom you can connect to, get inspired by and to know that you are not alone. It is a matter of time when diverse representation in tech becomes the new norm and we don't have to empower the already empowered under-represented folks.

It is literally true that we can succeed best and quickest by helping others to learn and succeed and with Women who code events together we can do so much. 

Begin by introducing yourself. Tell us why you are interested in becoming a Leadership Fellow.
Next, we want to hear your Women Who Code pitch! Pretend you are starting your first event as a Fellow and share the WWCode Mission, Vision, and Code of Conduct.

I gave my first keynote at WWCode Connect Recharge 2022. I am humbled by this opportunity. As a leadership fellow with WWCode I get to interact with the community and be recognised as a leader outside of my regular day to day job too. Thank you WWCode!
