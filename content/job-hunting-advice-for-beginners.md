Regarding the article that I mentioned about a portfolio website is not important while applying for your first developer job, [here](https://profy.dev/article/portfolio-websites-survey) is the link to it.

In addition to that, as I mentioned during the call, focus on your learnings and convince the hiring manager of how much learning you have done until now and are willing to do. From my personal experience, when I hire for junior positions all I look for is their attitude for learning.

With regards to your other question regarding what core fundamentals are required to be a great front-end developer:
For the beginner level, it's all about how quickly you are able to grasp new concepts, demonstrate a willingness to learn, and iterate over them. [This](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/how-to-learn-stuff-quickly/) is a good article on how to learn things quickly.
As you are learning, you will eventually figure out the things that you are interested in and would want to learn more of that, practice, and get better.
Your peers and the job itself might show you new opportunities and you need to be ready to step out of your comfort zone, work on those, ask questions and learn new things on the fly. The learning pattern gets built this way.
As you are learning and exploring, try to establish a pattern where you understand the 'why' behind what you are doing. The 'how' part is usually covered by tutorials, searching on the internet, etc. It is being able to understand the 'why' behind what you are doing will help you learn things faster and let you connect the dots as you get introduced to newer concepts and topics. [This](https://twitter.com/chrishlad/status/1424704009424752646) is a nice tweet on exponential learning.
In [this](https://roadmap.sh/frontend) article, you will find a broader range of topics for a front-end developer. But the core of it will be HTML, Vanilla JavaScript and CSS. Using libraries or frameworks will always be in addition to these core concepts, and the kind of topics that you will get to work with will depend on your job, your team, the product. 

What applications should I apply for as a beginner? Are there any keywords I should be looking out for?
Look out for jobs that explicitly hire for junior roles. Some of the questions to ask your hiring manager would be the following:
- do you offer mentorship? this is very important because as a junior you need good support from the team for onboarding and mentorship
- is there a learning budget? or is there time to learn new things as part of the job? this is important too because when you are a beginner you need mentorship + time to learn new things. it should not be that you just fix bugs or work on new features for the product/company and learning is not given importance. You will then end up being overwhelmed, or not enjoy your work over the long term when you cannot learn and grow.   

2) Do you have dev job website recommendations?
none in particular. the best way to apply as a beginner is through networking or connections. talk to people, join communities and discover opportunities. when you know someone working at a company and if they are able to refer you internally the process is faster.

3) Do you have an example of an outstanding resume I can see?
I don't have one. But you can send me yours and I can review it. For beginners, I would prefer a one-page format (not a hard rule, but better). List your academic or self-study coursework relevant to the job you are applying for, list 2-3 projects that you worked on, mention what tools and tech stack you used, and most importantly highlight in your project work a specific problem you would have solved, the things that you are proud of.
A resume is your marketing pitch to the recruiter/hiring manager, so give a thought about the message that you want to convey and capture their attention.
