I have had a great Sunday so far, and I still have time today to quickly jot down something for a daily blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spend time with the WWCode Frontend technical track community as a Leadership Fellow. During the beginning of this year 2022, I started a bi-weekly series called &lt;a href="https://frontendstudygroup.github.io/blog/tags/what-to-learn"&gt;"What to Learn"&lt;/a&gt; to share ideas to learn new topics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was very happy with the outcome and this experiment that took place in Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What to learn - summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I published 6 articles in this series, 3 of which were contributed by the wwcode frontend community. My goal was this to be a community led series and with 2 people coming forward to write 3 posts was a big win for me and goal accomplised for this experiment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I learned and wrote about &lt;a href="./tag/serverless"&gt;Serverless&lt;/a&gt; and also built a slack integration (aka bot) to bookmark articles shared in wwcode's frontend slack which were then consolidated into a blog post to showcase community's learnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Writing consistently is not easy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have had many failed attempts in the past to publish content regularly. Given this history I was very cautious with this bi-weekly series and wanted to make sure this is a limited edition (for Q1 2022 only) and not to overwhelm myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were multiple times that I felt after the first month, i.e. after the first 2 posts in January, when I had to write in February I did not find the time, found 2 weeks was too short, and I had to push myself. This is where I encouraged folks from the community to write and was happy when 2 people expressed interest and wrote 3 posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am on the 9th day of my daily writing spree. Fingers crossed that this becomes a daily habit!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to find new topics to learn&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://princiya.com/blog/how-to-learn/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; post I have explained how to learn new topics or how not to give up on the learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While there is lot of advice on how to learn, the best way to learn new things is by doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my time as a mentor for the MLH Fellowship, I met many interesting mentees. One of them was building a Github clone, i.e. his own version of Github and during my conversations with him I learned about &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor"&gt;monaco editor&lt;/a&gt;, the editor that powers VSCode!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a great example to find new topics to learn, i.e. identify topics from the daily things that we use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href="https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; great resource to build your own version of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; through my colleague during our 1:1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How to find opensource projects to contribute&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if you want to contribute to opensource, the best way is to look for projects that you use on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, in the frontend world, look for Typescript's codebase, or even React or React Native's codebase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or eslint, babel, Jest, etc. All source code is there on Github and is a great way to look into the current issues on these projects and see if you can contribute or fix some &lt;code&gt;good-first-bugs&lt;/code&gt; from these codebases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this is your first time contribution, then these are not recommended, it can be overwhelming. You can search for good first projects for first time opensource contributions and you can find a better list.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Mentoring"></category><category term="learning"></category></entry><entry><title>How does a successful career look like</title><link href="https://princiya.com/newblog/how-does-a-successful-career-look-like.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-05-25T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-05-25T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Princiya Sequeira</name></author><id>tag:princiya.com,2022-05-25:/newblog/how-does-a-successful-career-look-like.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I had to replace my sick colleague today for an interview.

&lt;p&gt;The candidate has a music background. And he said he would answer this question from a musician's point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success to him would be getting to work with more interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a musician, he would like to pair with a person to be able to play the best music and this what he expected out of his career too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software as gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, writing code was like gardening. Things don't go as expected all the times, you need to sow the seeds carefully and wait till it flourishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to prune the weeds --&amp;gt; refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I concluded the interview on the following note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a year! On this day, last year, I resigned from my previous job where I was the Head of Frontend Engineering at Curalie GmbH for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had grown in this role into engineering leadership and I could not have been happier with my career path. But after 3 years, it was also the time for me to move on and look for bigger challenges in an environment where values and culture were more valuable for the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My time at Curalie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined Curalie as a Senior Frontend Engineer and took up the role as Lead Engineer shortly. During this time, I had a team to manage while also overseeing the product deliverables. I was one of the first 5 engineers in the company when I had joined and at the time when I left, the tech team was about ~50, and the frontend team had grown to ~12 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still hands-on coding on that role. On the frontend, our team used React and React Native. My favorite accomplishments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up the entire automated build pipeline for React Native using Fastlane &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up automated end to end testing for React using Cypress, including api testing using Pact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up automated end to end - integration testing for React Native using Testproject.io that worked well with our manual QA team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategising product deliverables and aligning the entire team with the roadmap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empathetic and authentic leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decision to move on was not hard, but emotional&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resigning from Curalie was not hard, but it turned out to be emotional, more than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resigned, submitted my papers and had a loud cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is during this time that I realised that I just had a job break up, a job that I enjoyed and had grown as a person and a leader. I had to grieve over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked the following question in Elpha.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Elpha community,
I handed in my resignation at work today. Although I still have the 3-month notice period and was passively preparing for this resignation, I was not ready for the kind of emotions I am having today.
I cried aloud and now I have this sense of loss although I know something exciting is waiting ahead.
How to deal with this or how to mourn effectively?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got good advice from folks and I decided to use the time to say goodbyes to colleagues and work on a good handover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://elpha.com/posts/kpo019t4/how-to-mourn-after-job-resignation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviewing and grieving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As funny as it apears to me today, on the day I resigned I sent an email to Anaconda saying after the first HR screen I was no longer interested in continuing the inteview process. Jessica, SVP Operations at Anaconda convinced me that I should take the Manager screen interview which was scheduled for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to grieve and I was not ready for an interview. I was tired and needed a break. But since the interview was already scheduled for the next day I decided to continue the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manager screen at Anaconda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no major expectations from the interview, but just after the interview started and I was talking to Nick, the then VP Engineering, I felt a connection. We also spoke about my resignation, me mourning and also how I was not looking forward to the interview and wanted it to be cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the hour, the call went beyond ~10 mins, and we both were happy about our interview. I wanted to a job at Anaconda and I was looking forward to the next rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the next panel rounds, I met amazing people who are now great colleagues. During the final round, I met Kevin, CTO, who is now my Manager at Anaconda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had 30 minutes scheduled, and knowing how busy a CTO would be, I had tried to read up as much as I could about Kevin so that I could ask him good questions in the 5 minutes that I would get after he would be done asking me questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Kevin surprised me and asked if I had any questions in the beginning itself. My homework did pay, and we had a good conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always listen to myself, always on the watch for any signs that bother me. I give a second chance, but beyond that I treat as warning signs and then believe in taking necessary actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although things were good at Curalie, things became limited for my growth both in terms of salary and impact. I decided to resign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mourning over a job was a new experience and it is a thing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Mentoring"></category><category term="job"></category><category term="story"></category></entry><entry><title>My Career Path</title><link href="https://princiya.com/newblog/my-career-path.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-05-21T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-05-21T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Princiya Sequeira</name></author><id>tag:princiya.com,2022-05-21:/newblog/my-career-path.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cover image" src="images/career.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Princiya Sequeira and I am an Engineering Manager at Anaconda in Germany.
I am from India and I relocated to Germany 7 years ago.
I have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science engineering, a dozen years of experience building full-stack web and mobile apps, and leading technical teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my initial years as a Software Engineer, I worked at a startup, so I had the opportunity to do full-stack, understand BE systems, dev ops, databases, UI design, etc. If I can recollect, it's this learning environment that I had that led me to learn and grow in my career. Sometimes I had to do photoshop, sometimes Java, or sometimes think about why our system was down and running slowly. I was also taking basic lessons on machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important lesson I learned was that code should not be written for the sake of writing, but we need to understand what we expect to achieve and what we want the machines to respond to.
I was working at a startup, and a lot of people including my parents were asking me to leave this company and join a bigger firm. But I stuck to it mainly because I realized how much I had to learn. As they say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No risk, no story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the career path I wanted, I chose it for myself and I have worked hard for this. Most important: I am very happy today and I continue to love what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also spend my time with the women who code community as a leadership fellow in the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a woman leader in tech has helped me to bring in more women, and under-represented folks into the tech world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My philosophy about being a great leader is about being a good human being first. I like being authentic about myself. It is about who I am and being able to bring myself wholly into the job. I encourage others to do the same. Creating this kind of environment where everyone can be authentic about themselves is what I strive for. Empathy is the next important trait I care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often advise people to chase their dreams. Create a learning curve for yourself, and get it verified by your peers or mentors. Find yourself a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be afraid to ask questions and make sure whatever you choose for yourself, you are happy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Mentoring"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="story"></category><category term="pitch"></category></entry><entry><title>Resume Review</title><link href="https://princiya.com/newblog/resume-review.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-02-15T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2022-02-15T00:00:00+01:00</updated><author><name>Princiya Sequeira</name></author><id>tag:princiya.com,2022-02-15:/newblog/resume-review.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cover image" src="images/resume.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following is an excerpt from "RE:View Series - Resume Review" that I organised for WWCode Frontend in February 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resume is your marketing pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following is an excerpt from "RE:View Series - Resume Review" that I organised for WWCode Frontend in February 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good advice I have received is - apply for jobs not when you need them but apply for jobs when you need the least so that you have nothing to lose, can perform well under pressure. So that also applies to make sure you constantly update your resume to know the trends, what works vs what does not. 🙂 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-English speakers, would recommend to use a grammar checker. I am not a native speaker myself and always use Grammarly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+100 to recruiters/hiring managers scan the resume very quickly. Personally, I can scan a resume very quickly and will get an initial impression less than 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend .pdf resumes but with working hyperlinks if you include them. .doc or other formats can corrupt when you upload/share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any guidance on what should go first, experience or education?
Me to Everyone (18:27)
Relevant experience would be better. Since education although important these days we give value to project work and experience.
C S to Host and Panelists (18:27)
Question. For skill section, should we include html, css, and javascript? Or if I say React and taiwind(or any css frameworks) is just fine?
Jiaqi to Everyone (18:28)
Hi all! By default chat is set to send to &lt;code&gt;Host and Panelists&lt;/code&gt; only. If you’d like your questions or comments to be viewed by everyone you can switch the To: field to &lt;code&gt;Everyone&lt;/code&gt;
C S to Host and Panelists (18:28)
got it
Me to Everyone (18:28)
For general skills: better to keep it generic - html, css, JS. For project specific mention in depth about react, tailwind etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, what if internship project was developed in php and we want to apply for other tech then can we keep it in resume?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 page vs 2
write bullet points
write what you are comfortable with
grammar checks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the internship project was not deployed due to some issue, still we can put it right?
Yes sure. Internship projects are still useful. If this is your first real job or another internship application, then as long as you have lessons learned from your project, put it down. For juniors being able to show and demonstrate your learning curve is very important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what if the unrelated job experience is your current employer and you only point out collaboration, problem solving, and adaptability bullets?
assuming you will switch jobs. then it is ok to list unrelated job experience as a brief summary. and be able to show anything relevant experience/projects to the job you are applying itself would be good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Can you please tell if someone wants to switch career from full stack developer to Data scientist, then what to put in resume? All work related to full stack wont help much right? or we should wait and do some data science projects and then switch?
For example, let’s say you have been a full stack for a few years. Now you want to switch to data scientist. If you switch within your existing company you have higher chances since they know you and your work already. Externally if you apply for a different job then you will have to prove yourself how can you navigate through the role. so sometimes high chances you will be considered junior there. Makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How closely does the resume need to match your LinkedIn profile, structure-wise and wording… esp if we’re building more than one resume (i.e., to, say, apply for 2 different jobs)
Jiaqi to Everyone (18:55)
It doesn’t need to match. But having a strong LinkedIn profile makes you more discoverable. There’s different strategies there.
Jana Panarites to Everyone (18:55)
Thanks Jiaqu!
Jiaqi  :-/
C S to Everyone (18:56)
very helpful critiques! thank you so much
Jiaqi to Everyone (18:56)
By more discoverable, I mean if you have a strong LinkedIn profile, recruiters and Hiring Managers will come to you and reach out to you for relevant roles.
Stephanie Rideout to Everyone (18:56)
Your LinkedIn profile is an excellent space to include additional information, such as extra portfolio links, participation in hackathons, volunteer commitments, etc.
Me to Everyone (18:56)
+1 to what Jiaqi says. It doesn’t have to match. But the overall gist of your message that you want to tell via resume needs to be consistent. Or would be nice that you are consistent 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm transitioning into tech, how much previous non-tech experience should go on the resume?
non-tech experience would not matter. so keep it short and brief. try to highlight your learnings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men apply for jobs where they have 60% of the “required skills” posted; women apply only when they have 100%.  I’ve learned that as women, we must get over it and APPLY APPLY APPLY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;normalise taking career break!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! I have a question about obtaining metrics for a resume, ex. "Increased user efficiency by 30%.....", "reduced compile time by 15%", etc. I often hear an emphasis to include numbers and data concerning your responsibilities at a job to make it sound more concrete, but I was always curious as to how you can get these!? Do you talk to your engineering manager, tech lead, or is this something you estimate/calculate yourself?
I mean in all seriousness, those are best guess metrics. You can talk to your EM or Tech Lead but they’ll probably have to guesstimate too. If you have a healthy relationship with your co-workers, you can get their perspective.
But generally if you own a project, own an initiative, you are the best qualified person to measure success metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
