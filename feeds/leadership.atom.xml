&lt;p&gt;This can be an interview question and it is very important to be prepared with a good answer here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I was asked this interview question during one of the panel rounds at Anaconda, I really liked this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first obvious difference to come to my mind based on my experience is that as a leader I often try to lead by an example. As a manager, I need to ensure that I manage people and project deliverables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Leader&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Manager&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;One who leads&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;One who manages&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Leading by examples and leading from the front&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Manage people and projects&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Influence and motivate the team&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Delegate, orchestrate things within the team&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All leaders are not managers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined Anaconda in September 2021. During the pandemic, although I got used to working in a remote work setup, starting a new job in a remote first setup was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined Anaconda in September 2021. During the pandemic, although I got used to working in a remote work setup, starting a new job in a remote first setup was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The difference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my time at Curalie, ~1 year was spent in pandemic and remote setup. Things were direct and it was a smooth transition, mostly because I knew the team, I knew the product, I knew the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Anaconda, I didn’t know my team, I didn’t know the product, I didn’t know the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onboarding was not only about getting the job done, but it also involved dealing with the online fatigue, and timezone differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wished to see people and interact with them in real life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have a good 30-6-90 day RAMP plan and I used this as an opportunity to understand my primary priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My top priority was getting the EM’s job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was new at the company, I also used the time to interact with colleagues on slack, participate in initiatives that were not directly related to my team and get to know other teams and people too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ask questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the remote-first setup, joining Anaconda to me was coming to a Python world from Javascript. Most of the things obvious to folks was not obvious to me. I had to step back often and learn so many new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to phrase answers and be courageous to talk about them so that I could be corrected and learn from the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drew diagrams to help visualise things better and learn things faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What can be improved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have great empathy for new hires across Anaconda. For the ones in my team, I let them know that the onboarding process can be overwhelming, and we try to improve this experience one step at a time for the folks joining next. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Monday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usally need a lot of warm up time on Monday mornings and get productive on Mondays only towards the second half of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Monday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usally need a lot of warm up time on Monday mornings and get productive on Mondays only towards the second half of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monday's yak shaving on Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to have a productive Monday, I make sure I have a prioritised list ready on my desk on Friday evening. This is something I started practising recently, and has been working very well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the weekend, I make sure I don't do any work related things and start work directly on Monday morning. The prioritised list helps me with relevant context to start the Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analog notes taking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My note taking method is analog. I jot down notes on pen and paper. My biggest satisfaction over the week is crossing off the todos from my list and tossing the paper into the dustbin. This feels like such a big relief from a mental load point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does it help me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if the analog way would help me be productive. In this digital age, should I too not make a digital move? How will I access the information from everywhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a good memory, but when dealing with multipel things and constant context switching and interruption driven development, it is only natural that I cannot track each and every thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my analog notes taking, I make it a point to visit my notes every now and then. I write my important todos in a different paper, while writing the random things as they pop up in another paper. This can be multiple papers for a given day based on the workload. When I revisit my notes every now and then, the frequency I am talking about is atleast twice a week, it helps me refresh my memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then start writing them over again in a new paper and recategorise and reprioritise. Writing over again and revisiting does help me stay on top of things, and there is very little chance to miss out or forget things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Isn't digital better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With digital ways, it does help me track notes from outside, when I am not on my work desk. But I have little motivation to revisit my digital todos over and over again and hence things sit idle or unvisited for a long time. During this time, my memory is replaced with other things and I forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be better digital ways, offcourse I am not debating on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my choice is analog notes taking, highlight with colors, revisit and get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very productive, and I can totally recommed this way of doing incase you are looking to find a productive way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Monday! :) &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Leadership"></category><category term="priorities"></category><category term="time"></category></entry></feed>
