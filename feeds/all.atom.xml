&lt;p&gt;My last question to this candidate was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does success look like for you in your career?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Working with interesting people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The candidate has a music background. And he said he would answer this question from a musician's point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success to him would be getting to work with more interesting people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a musician, he would like to pair with a person to be able to play the best music and this what he expected out of his career too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Software as gardening&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said, writing code was like gardening. Things don't go as expected all the times, you need to sow the seeds carefully and wait till it flourishes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need to prune the weeds --&amp;gt; refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I concluded the interview on the following note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are bugs in both places! Software &amp;amp; gardening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined Anaconda in September 2021. During the pandemic, although I got used to working in a remote work setup, starting a new job in a remote first setup was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I joined Anaconda in September 2021. During the pandemic, although I got used to working in a remote work setup, starting a new job in a remote first setup was difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The difference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my time at Curalie, ~1 year was spent in pandemic and remote setup. Things were direct and it was a smooth transition, mostly because I knew the team, I knew the product, I knew the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Anaconda, I didn’t know my team, I didn’t know the product, I didn’t know the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onboarding was not only about getting the job done, but it also involved dealing with the online fatigue, and timezone differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wished to see people and interact with them in real life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What did I do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do have a good 30-6-90 day RAMP plan and I used this as an opportunity to understand my primary priorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My top priority was getting the EM’s job done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since I was new at the company, I also used the time to interact with colleagues on slack, participate in initiatives that were not directly related to my team and get to know other teams and people too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ask questions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apart from the remote-first setup, joining Anaconda to me was coming to a Python world from Javascript. Most of the things obvious to folks was not obvious to me. I had to step back often and learn so many new things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I kept asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried to phrase answers and be courageous to talk about them so that I could be corrected and learn from the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I drew diagrams to help visualise things better and learn things faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What can be improved&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have great empathy for new hires across Anaconda. For the ones in my team, I let them know that the onboarding process can be overwhelming, and we try to improve this experience one step at a time for the folks joining next. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Monday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usally need a lot of warm up time on Monday mornings and get productive on Mondays only towards the second half of the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Monday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usally need a lot of warm up time on Monday mornings and get productive on Mondays only towards the second half of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Monday's yak shaving on Friday&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to have a productive Monday, I make sure I have a prioritised list ready on my desk on Friday evening. This is something I started practising recently, and has been working very well for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the weekend, I make sure I don't do any work related things and start work directly on Monday morning. The prioritised list helps me with relevant context to start the Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Analog notes taking&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My note taking method is analog. I jot down notes on pen and paper. My biggest satisfaction over the week is crossing off the todos from my list and tossing the paper into the dustbin. This feels like such a big relief from a mental load point of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How does it help me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was wondering if the analog way would help me be productive. In this digital age, should I too not make a digital move? How will I access the information from everywhere?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a good memory, but when dealing with multipel things and constant context switching and interruption driven development, it is only natural that I cannot track each and every thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With my analog notes taking, I make it a point to visit my notes every now and then. I write my important todos in a different paper, while writing the random things as they pop up in another paper. This can be multiple papers for a given day based on the workload. When I revisit my notes every now and then, the frequency I am talking about is atleast twice a week, it helps me refresh my memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then start writing them over again in a new paper and recategorise and reprioritise. Writing over again and revisiting does help me stay on top of things, and there is very little chance to miss out or forget things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Isn't digital better&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With digital ways, it does help me track notes from outside, when I am not on my work desk. But I have little motivation to revisit my digital todos over and over again and hence things sit idle or unvisited for a long time. During this time, my memory is replaced with other things and I forget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There might be better digital ways, offcourse I am not debating on that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But my choice is analog notes taking, highlight with colors, revisit and get things done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am very productive, and I can totally recommed this way of doing incase you are looking to find a productive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been a year! On this day, last year, I resigned from my previous job where I was the Head of Frontend Engineering at Curalie GmbH for 3 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had grown in this role into engineering leadership and I could not have been happier with my career path. But after 3 years, it was also the time for me to move on and look for bigger challenges in an environment where values and culture were more valuable for the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My time at Curalie&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I joined Curalie as a Senior Frontend Engineer and took up the role as Lead Engineer shortly. During this time, I had a team to manage while also overseeing the product deliverables. I was one of the first 5 engineers in the company when I had joined and at the time when I left, the tech team was about ~50, and the frontend team had grown to ~12 people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was still hands-on coding on that role. On the frontend, our team used React and React Native. My favorite accomplishments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up the entire automated build pipeline for React Native using Fastlane &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up automated end to end testing for React using Cypress, including api testing using Pact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up automated end to end - integration testing for React Native using Testproject.io that worked well with our manual QA team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategising product deliverables and aligning the entire team with the roadmap&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empathetic and authentic leadership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Decision to move on was not hard, but emotional&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Resigning from Curalie was not hard, but it turned out to be emotional, more than I expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I resigned, submitted my papers and had a loud cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is during this time that I realised that I just had a job break up, a job that I enjoyed and had grown as a person and a leader. I had to grieve over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked the following question in Elpha.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dear Elpha community,
I handed in my resignation at work today. Although I still have the 3-month notice period and was passively preparing for this resignation, I was not ready for the kind of emotions I am having today.
I cried aloud and now I have this sense of loss although I know something exciting is waiting ahead.
How to deal with this or how to mourn effectively?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got good advice from folks and I decided to use the time to say goodbyes to colleagues and work on a good handover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://elpha.com/posts/kpo019t4/how-to-mourn-after-job-resignation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Interviewing and grieving&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As funny as it apears to me today, on the day I resigned I sent an email to Anaconda saying after the first HR screen I was no longer interested in continuing the inteview process. Jessica, SVP Operations at Anaconda convinced me that I should take the Manager screen interview which was scheduled for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had to grieve and I was not ready for an interview. I was tired and needed a break. But since the interview was already scheduled for the next day I decided to continue the interview process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Manager screen at Anaconda&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had no major expectations from the interview, but just after the interview started and I was talking to Nick, the then VP Engineering, I felt a connection. We also spoke about my resignation, me mourning and also how I was not looking forward to the interview and wanted it to be cancelled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towards the end of the hour, the call went beyond ~10 mins, and we both were happy about our interview. I wanted to a job at Anaconda and I was looking forward to the next rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the next panel rounds, I met amazing people who are now great colleagues. During the final round, I met Kevin, CTO, who is now my Manager at Anaconda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had 30 minutes scheduled, and knowing how busy a CTO would be, I had tried to read up as much as I could about Kevin so that I could ask him good questions in the 5 minutes that I would get after he would be done asking me questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Kevin surprised me and asked if I had any questions in the beginning itself. My homework did pay, and we had a good conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I always listen to myself, always on the watch for any signs that bother me. I give a second chance, but beyond that I treat as warning signs and then believe in taking necessary actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although things were good at Curalie, things became limited for my growth both in terms of salary and impact. I decided to resign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But mourning over a job was a new experience and it is a thing!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Mentoring"></category><category term="job"></category><category term="story"></category></entry><entry><title>My Career Path</title><link href="https://princiya.com/newblog/my-career-path.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-05-21T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-05-21T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Princiya Sequeira</name></author><id>tag:princiya.com,2022-05-21:/newblog/my-career-path.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cover image" src="images/career.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name is Princiya Sequeira and I am an Engineering Manager at Anaconda in Germany.
I am from India and I relocated to Germany 7 years ago.
I have a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science engineering, a dozen years of experience building full-stack web and mobile apps, and leading technical teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During my initial years as a Software Engineer, I worked at a startup, so I had the opportunity to do full-stack, understand BE systems, dev ops, databases, UI design, etc. If I can recollect, it's this learning environment that I had that led me to learn and grow in my career. Sometimes I had to do photoshop, sometimes Java, or sometimes think about why our system was down and running slowly. I was also taking basic lessons on machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One important lesson I learned was that code should not be written for the sake of writing, but we need to understand what we expect to achieve and what we want the machines to respond to.
I was working at a startup, and a lot of people including my parents were asking me to leave this company and join a bigger firm. But I stuck to it mainly because I realized how much I had to learn. As they say,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No risk, no story!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the career path I wanted, I chose it for myself and I have worked hard for this. Most important: I am very happy today and I continue to love what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also spend my time with the women who code community as a leadership fellow in the front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a woman leader in tech has helped me to bring in more women, and under-represented folks into the tech world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My philosophy about being a great leader is about being a good human being first. I like being authentic about myself. It is about who I am and being able to bring myself wholly into the job. I encourage others to do the same. Creating this kind of environment where everyone can be authentic about themselves is what I strive for. Empathy is the next important trait I care about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often advise people to chase their dreams. Create a learning curve for yourself, and get it verified by your peers or mentors. Find yourself a mentor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do not be afraid to ask questions and make sure whatever you choose for yourself, you are happy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Mentoring"></category><category term="career"></category><category term="story"></category></entry><entry><title>Hello Pelican!</title><link href="https://princiya.com/newblog/hello-pelican.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2022-05-20T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2022-05-20T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>Princiya Sequeira</name></author><id>tag:princiya.com,2022-05-20:/newblog/hello-pelican.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cover image" src="./images/pelican.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally did it! This is my first attempt to move away from Gatsby, static site generator that I used to write my blog previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that I work at Anaconda, and how everything revolves around Python, I decided to try Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first encounter with Pelican was when I worked on engineering.anaconda.com last month and customised CSS there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why no to Gatsby&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby was getting slow, and I knew at some point I had to migrate away from Gatsby. The last post I had published was in January.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, during FOSS Friday at Anaconda (once a month we all work on opensource projects) I decided to write a blog post for Anaconda's blog. I wanted to publish the first version of my draft on my blog, but when I tried to deploy Gatsby, it would not run. After &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; no. of efforts, event trying to upgrade to Gatsby v3 and v4, I had no luck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why no to Hashnode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My first choice was Hashnode, I had heard lot of good things about Hashnode and how Hashnode let users customise SEO too. I was able to publish my blog post on Hashnode, and in the excitement I also published 2 additional posts that I was wanting to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hashnode was very easy to use and setup. But in the end I wanted to own and be able to customise my blog the way I wanted. I even considered paid options, because in ~6 months time I didn't want to run into the same problem I faced with Gatsby; i.e. either the tech dependencies get outdated and I need to spend time on catching up with the latest versions or some platform like Hashnode ends up restrictions on users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pelican it is&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past, I have tried Jekyll and Hugo. I was not happy with both of them, mainly because they were not Javascript based. This is the reason, I was very happy in using Gatsby, and to add to my comfort, it was React based. I did get to learn GraphQL too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the comfort zone I was in, I chose to ignore all of Gatsby's warning signs and at the time of writing this blog post I had to finally choose between Hashnode vs Pelican, and I chose Pelican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Next steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the last 2 years, I did spend decent time in customising my Gatsby blog; CSS, content and social sharing cards. In fact, I also wrote a custom Gatsby plugin to have automated social sharing cards in GIFs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, I have all the things I need from Pelican. I will focus on writing as a consistent habit and when I get time I will try to migrate my entire blog to this newer version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following is an excerpt from "RE:View Series - Resume Review" that I organised for WWCode Frontend in February 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Resume is your marketing pitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following is an excerpt from "RE:View Series - Resume Review" that I organised for WWCode Frontend in February 2022.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A good advice I have received is - apply for jobs not when you need them but apply for jobs when you need the least so that you have nothing to lose, can perform well under pressure. So that also applies to make sure you constantly update your resume to know the trends, what works vs what does not. 🙂 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For non-English speakers, would recommend to use a grammar checker. I am not a native speaker myself and always use Grammarly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;+100 to recruiters/hiring managers scan the resume very quickly. Personally, I can scan a resume very quickly and will get an initial impression less than 10 seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend .pdf resumes but with working hyperlinks if you include them. .doc or other formats can corrupt when you upload/share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any guidance on what should go first, experience or education?
Me to Everyone (18:27)
Relevant experience would be better. Since education although important these days we give value to project work and experience.
C S to Host and Panelists (18:27)
Question. For skill section, should we include html, css, and javascript? Or if I say React and taiwind(or any css frameworks) is just fine?
Jiaqi to Everyone (18:28)
Hi all! By default chat is set to send to &lt;code&gt;Host and Panelists&lt;/code&gt; only. If you’d like your questions or comments to be viewed by everyone you can switch the To: field to &lt;code&gt;Everyone&lt;/code&gt;
C S to Host and Panelists (18:28)
got it
Me to Everyone (18:28)
For general skills: better to keep it generic - html, css, JS. For project specific mention in depth about react, tailwind etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi, what if internship project was developed in php and we want to apply for other tech then can we keep it in resume?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1 page vs 2
write bullet points

&lt;p&gt;the internship project was not deployed due to some issue, still we can put it right?
Yes sure. Internship projects are still useful. If this is your first real job or another internship application, then as long as you have lessons learned from your project, put it down. For juniors being able to show and demonstrate your learning curve is very important&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;what if the unrelated job experience is your current employer and you only point out collaboration, problem solving, and adaptability bullets?
assuming you will switch jobs. then it is ok to list unrelated job experience as a brief summary. and be able to show anything relevant experience/projects to the job you are applying itself would be good&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, Can you please tell if someone wants to switch career from full stack developer to Data scientist, then what to put in resume? All work related to full stack wont help much right? or we should wait and do some data science projects and then switch?
For example, let’s say you have been a full stack for a few years. Now you want to switch to data scientist. If you switch within your existing company you have higher chances since they know you and your work already. Externally if you apply for a different job then you will have to prove yourself how can you navigate through the role. so sometimes high chances you will be considered junior there. Makes sense?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How closely does the resume need to match your LinkedIn profile, structure-wise and wording… esp if we’re building more than one resume (i.e., to, say, apply for 2 different jobs)

It doesn’t need to match. But having a strong LinkedIn profile makes you more discoverable. There’s different strategies there.

Thanks Jiaqu!
Jiaqi  :-/
C S to Everyone (18:56)
very helpful critiques! thank you so much
Jiaqi to Everyone (18:56)
By more discoverable, I mean if you have a strong LinkedIn profile, recruiters and Hiring Managers will come to you and reach out to you for relevant roles.
Stephanie Rideout to Everyone (18:56)
Your LinkedIn profile is an excellent space to include additional information, such as extra portfolio links, participation in hackathons, volunteer commitments, etc.
Me to Everyone (18:56)
+1 to what Jiaqi says. It doesn’t have to match. But the overall gist of your message that you want to tell via resume needs to be consistent. Or would be nice that you are consistent 🙂&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I'm transitioning into tech, how much previous non-tech experience should go on the resume?
non-tech experience would not matter. so keep it short and brief. try to highlight your learnings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Men apply for jobs where they have 60% of the “required skills” posted; women apply only when they have 100%.  I’ve learned that as women, we must get over it and APPLY APPLY APPLY&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;normalise taking career break!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! I have a question about obtaining metrics for a resume, ex. "Increased user efficiency by 30%.....", "reduced compile time by 15%", etc. I often hear an emphasis to include numbers and data concerning your responsibilities at a job to make it sound more concrete, but I was always curious as to how you can get these!? Do you talk to your engineering manager, tech lead, or is this something you estimate/calculate yourself?
I mean in all seriousness, those are best guess metrics. You can talk to your EM or Tech Lead but they’ll probably have to guesstimate too. If you have a healthy relationship with your co-workers, you can get their perspective.
But generally if you own a project, own an initiative, you are the best qualified person to measure success metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
