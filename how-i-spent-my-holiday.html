    <p>It is a 4-day long weekend. Yesterday, 26th May was a German public holiday, and today is a snake day holiday from Anaconda.</p>
<p>I spent the entire day yesterday preparing for my <a href="./reset-recharge">keynote talk at WWCode Connect 2022</a>, which was very well received. There was a lot of positive feedback and appreciation. Personally, I am very happy with this talk.</p>
<h2>Snake days at Anaconda</h2>
<p>At Anaconda, we have a snake day holiday every month. In Germany, in addition to the 30 day annual leave, we also get snake day holidays. So we have 30 + 12 days of annual leave at Anaconda.</p>
<p>We are hiring at Anaconda, do check open roles or contact me if you are interested.</p>
<h2>What did I do today</h2>
<p>I woke up late and got to my desk only an hour ago. At the time of writing this post, it is 17:04 CET.</p>
<p>I have been browsing random things, looking at some home office furniture to buy.</p>
<p>I watched a little bit of Bling Empire on Netflix earlier today. Riverdale, Bridgerton are on my list. I cannot believe Riverdale has a new season 6!</p>
<p>I have been following up on social media from yesterday's keynote comments and feedback.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://mailchi.mp/066157bf02bb/connect-forward-is-1-month-away-872086">following</a> was sent on today's WWCode newsletter, and I have been cross-posting this on my social media.</p>
<p><img alt="WWCode newsletter highlighted my keynote" src="./images/keynote.png"></p>
<h2>9 months at Anaconda</h2>
<p>When I have long weekends, I also sit and think about my career. Today was analysing how are things for me at Anaconda. I have been with Anaconda for 9 months now and things are really good, I am happy about my progress overall and the kind of problems I get to solve on a daily basis. There is so much learning happening everyday and so much work getting done.</p>
<p>Everyday I look forward to growing in my career, one step at a time.</p>
<h2>My reading list</h2>
<p>I read a few articles from Leaddev today.</p>
<p>I am now reading few system design articles from ByteByteGo.</p>
<p>I was following updates from InvactMetaversity, looks like the drama has been resolved today.</p>
<h2>Will I have my own startup</h2>
<p>I often think to myself, if I were to build something what would that be? I still have not found any answer.</p>
<p>I do occassionally come up with ideas and think they could be the next big thing. The following were the ones where I came close to get them executed, but did not. Obviously, had I done, it would have already been the next big thing :D. </p>
<ul>
<li>Portal to connect midwives and new moms</li>
<li>Automatic blog generator based on the content read or written for that week</li>
</ul>
<h2>Grow in my career</h2>
<p>While I am not sure about a startup, I am definitely aiming to grow in my career and I do believe I am in the right track!</p>
