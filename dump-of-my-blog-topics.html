<p>How to have healthy PR conversations?
You deserve to be paid fairly with regard to the level you are at and the work you do. You deserve to be leveled properly based on the value you contribute. Every worker deserves this.
Also, when you are tracking the work you've done, you can have a long list of things you did (activity), or you can have a long list of outcomes you made happen (value delivered). You will get paid / promoted on value you delivered. (If you are in a healthy system.) </p>
<p>Negotiating raises:
I have many thoughts on raises, but my tactics vary depending on my company and my role. In very early stage startups, there are usually no salary bands, not guidance, nor any formal review process. In those situations, I ask my boss for raises often, generally after I do a thing that brings a lot of value to the company.
In more mature companies, where there are review processes, salary bands and the like, I find it's more about advocacy for myself and what I have done within the context of the company process. I always want to be sure I'm fairly leveled compared to my peers. Also, having others advocate for you is important. Who are your allies? How do they help highlight your contributions? When you work on off-team efforts (guilds, hiring revamp, etc.), who sees that work? Are they relaying feedback to your manager, etc.?
I know it can feel tough to advocate for yourself, and that it takes practice doing that for it to feel less icky. But I often coach my engineers to do just that. Understanding the value of your labor in the market is important. Knowing what others who do what you do make in your region is important.</p>
<p>Motivation - Hygiene theory at work
Motivation factors include: challenging work; recognition for one’s achievements; responsibility; the opportunity to do something meaningful; involvement in decision making; and a sense of importance to the organization. On the other hand, hygiene factors include: salary; work conditions; company policy and administration; supervision; working relationships; status and security.</p>
