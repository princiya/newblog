    <p>This was my pitch while applying for the wwcode fellowship.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hi, My name is Princiya Sequeira. I am from India but now living in Germany. thanks to the job advertisement I found in the Women who code's newsletter 6 years ago which landed me a job here in Berlin. I have more than 10 years of experience building full-stack web &amp; mobile applications, and 3 years of experience leading technical teams at scale.</p>
<p>Apart from my day job, I also volunteer in coaching under-represented folks with opensource contributions, advise them with career decisions, resume reviews, and interview preparations. Given this background, I am very excited to apply for this leadership fellow position because I want to be able to make an impact to a larger global audience. As an underrepresented person in tech myself, I understand the challenges and do believe and strive to have a diverse representation at a technical leadership level at companies and in opensource. I do take pride in being able to be at an engineering management position which I envisioned 10 years ago and to get here I have had to overcome multiple hurdles. It's not an easy road and this is what definitely keeps me motivated, but often there are times when I am alone all by myself and nobody to the immediate rescue. Communities and events like this are a great place where you find similar people with whom you can connect to, get inspired by and to know that you are not alone. It is a matter of time when diverse representation in tech becomes the new norm and we don't have to empower the already empowered under-represented folks.</p>
<p>It is literally true that we can succeed best and quickest by helping others to learn and succeed and with Women who code events together we can do so much. </p>
<p>Begin by introducing yourself. Tell us why you are interested in becoming a Leadership Fellow.
Next, we want to hear your Women Who Code pitch! Pretend you are starting your first event as a Fellow and share the WWCode Mission, Vision, and Code of Conduct.</p>
<p>Planning
Promotion
Agenda</p>
<p>We want to know how you would plan your first event.This question is required. *
Explain the steps you would follow to plan the event, sharing as much detail as you'd like!</p>
<p>Topic - Theme
Marketing
Speakers
Budget
Feedback
Logistics
Registration
Quality
Code of conduct</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a topic. "Craft your own web development journey" - We want to showcase different topics that one can choose to strengthen their web development career path.</li>
<li>Find speaker(s), check their availability.</li>
<li>Call for speakers from the audience sign up if they have any interesting web development journey to share. Security, accessibility, developer tools, core web standards, performance optimisations, opensource contributions.</li>
<li>Arrange budget/sponsors: Speaker reimbursements, logistics.</li>
<li>Setup tools/software for: event registration, volunteer management, feedback collection, notify audience and communicate with them about event updates, moderate the event access and guest list, record the event.</li>
<li>Assign volunteers to tasks, event moderation, topic curation, logistics, etc.</li>
<li>Write a Code of conduct for the event.</li>
<li>Measure the event's success: Setup metrics to collect, gather feedback from audience and speakers</li>
</ul>
<p>How would you promote the event?This question is required. *
Consider the timeline, where you would promote it, etc.</p>
<ul>
<li>Promote the event primarily on social media: Twitter (start promotion asap details are finalised).</li>
<li>Write a blog post about the event (2-3 weeks prior)</li>
<li>Ask speakers, volunteers, audience to promote the event (before and during the event)</li>
<li>Excite the audience who has signed up with additional details about the events, topics, etc. via emails</li>
<li>Identify volunteers to participate in event promotion and track progress. Focus on open and clear communication to meet expectations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Describe the event agendaThis question is required. *
Explain start time, segments, duration, etc.</p>
<p>"Craft your own web development journey" - We want to showcase different topics that one can choose to strengthen their web development career path.
- Choose a time slot that best fits global audience.
- Ideally 3-5 hour event with wellness break, community chat time, etc. If there are ample topics and speaker availability then it could also be an 8 hour event.
- If an ideal time slot cannot be found, run the event in 2 batches so that majority of the audience can participate.
- Introduction (15 min)
- Speaker 1 (20 mins, 5 min QnA)
- 5 min break
- Speaker 2 (20 mins, 5 min QnA)
- 10 min break
- Lightning talks (30 mins)
- Break
- Ask me anything or panel discussion (45 mins)
- Game: (blind website design challenge or quiz)
- Wrap up</p>
<p>Q: How has Women Who Code impacted your career and why is it important to you?</p>
<p>I gave my first keynote at WWCode Connect Recharge 2022. I am humbled by this opportunity. As a leadership fellow with WWCode I get to interact with the community and be recognised as a leader outside of my regular day to day job too. Thank you WWCode!</p>
<p>Q: How will you benefit from this scholarship? Please share 2 professional goals.</p>
<p>I am looking at ways to scale my career to the next level and I believe this scholarship can help me get access to a leadership coach, a global community of other peers who are on a similar path and learn and grow alongside.</p>
